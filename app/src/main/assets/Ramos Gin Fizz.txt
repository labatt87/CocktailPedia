2 ounces gin
1 ounce cream
1 egg white
1/2 ounce lemon juice
1/2 ounce lime juice
2 teaspoons sugar, to taste
2-3 drops orange flower water
Seltzer
Directions
1.Combine everything except seltzer in a cocktail shaker. Tradition dictates that the drink be shaken very hard for at least one and preferably two full minutes with ice. You can cheat by either whisking the mixture with a milk-frother or whisk (or tossing a spring from a Hawthorne strainer into the shaker and using that to whip the ingredients) until foamy, and then shaking with ice for a good 20 seconds, or you can buckle down and take the fully authentic ride, while working off the calories youâ€™ll be taking in from the cream and sugar. Strain into a chilled Collins glass and add an ounce or two of chilled seltzer, to taste.
