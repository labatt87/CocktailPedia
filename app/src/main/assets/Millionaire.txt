4 ounces rye or bourbon
1 1/2 ounces Grand Marnier or orange cura√ßao
4 dashes absinthe or pastis
1/2 ounce grenadine
1/2 ounce lemon juice (optional)
1 egg white
Directions
1.Add rye (or bourbon), Grand Marnier, absinthe (or pastis), grenadine, lemon juice (if using), and egg white to cocktail shaker without ice. Shake vigorously for 15 seconds to blend all ingredients.

2.Fill shaker 2/3 full with ice. Shake again, vigorously, until egg white is frothy and drink is well-chilled, about 30 seconds.

3.If you shake the drink very well, twice, before straining, you should emulsify all the white before any of it curdles, and you can simply strain the drink into two chilled coupe glasses. If you open the shaker and see a few curdled bits of white, double-strain by pouring it out of the shaker through a standard strainer into a fine mesh or tea strainer held above the chilled glasses.
