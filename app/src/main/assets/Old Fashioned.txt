1 teaspoon (5g) superfine sugar (or 1 sugar cube)
2 to 3 dashes bitters (Angostura is traditional and works well; Fee Brothers Whiskey Barrel-Aged Old Fashioned Bitters are better)
2 ounces (60ml) bourbon or rye whiskey
Orange and/or cherry, to garnish (optional)
Directions
1.Place sugar in an Old Fashioned glass. Douse with bitters and add a few drops of water. Add whiskey and stir until sugar is dissolved. Add several large ice cubes and stir rapidly with a bar spoon to chill. Garnish, if you like, with a slice of orange and/or a cherry.
