2 ripe pears, divided (organic preferred)
1 vanilla bean
1 cup brandy
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
Directions
1.Wash and chop one pear, discarding the seeds and core. Leave the skin on. Split and scrape the vanilla bean.

2.Place one chopped pear and the vanilla bean in a sealable glass jar and cover with brandy. The jar should have enough room to add another cup of liquid later in the process. Seal and shake, then let steep for 2 days. Remove vanilla bean, and then let steep for another 3 days.

3.Chop the second pear, discarding the seeds and core. Add it to a pot, along with the water and sugar, then stir and bring to a boil on medium heat, about 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer for an additional 5 minutes. Let the syrup mixture cool.

4.Once cooled, pour the syrup (with the fruit) into the steeping jar. Shake and let steep for 2 days. Taste, and if desired flavor is achieved, strain through a fine mesh strainer and then a coffee filter into a bottle or jar.
