2 ounces whiskey
1 ounce fresh-squeezed lemon juice
1 teaspoon sugar
1 egg white (optional—use if you’re feeling mildly adventurous, or need a drink with a little more gravitas)
Directions
1.Pour ingredients into a cocktail shaker, fill with ice and shake for 10 seconds (if using the egg white, give it a little extra muscle and a little extra time). Strain into a chilled cocktail glass, or into an ice-filled Old Fashioned glass. Garnish with a cherry, a slice of orange, or everything or nothing at all.
