2 ounces VSOP Cognac, Armagnac, or good California brandy
1 ounce Cointreau
3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice, to taste
superfine sugar, for garnish (optional)
Directions
1.Optional: prepare cocktail glass by making a slit in a lemon wedge and running the cut edge around the rim of the glass; then dip the rim in a saucer of superfine sugar to create a thin crust; chill the glass until needed.
2.Combine brandy, Cointreau, and lemon juice in a cocktail shaker and fill with ice. Shake well until chilled, about 10 seconds. Strain into prepared glass; garnish with a twist of orange or lemon peel, if the urge comes across.
