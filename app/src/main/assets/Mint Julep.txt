1 teaspoon (5g) sugar, to taste, dissolved in 1 teaspoon (5ml) water (or use 2 teaspoons/10ml simple syrup)
8 to 10 leaves fresh mint
Crushed ice
2 to 3 ounces (60 to 90ml) bourbon, to taste
Mint sprigs, for garnish
Directions
1.Place sugar and water at the bottom of a julep cup or tall glass and stir until sugar is dissolved. (You can also speed up the process by using simple syrup.) Add mint leaves and gently bruise with a wooden muddler or a wooden spoon. Take care not to overwork the mint, but swab the sides of the glass with the mint's aromatic oils. Half-fill glass with crushed ice and add bourbon, stirring to combine. Fill glass completely with crushed ice and stir until outside of glass frosts. Add more crushed ice if needed to fill and generously adorn drink with sprigs of fresh mint. Serve with a short straw, so that the fragrance of the mint bouquet will greet the drinker with each sip.
