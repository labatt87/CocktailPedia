1 1/2 to 2 ounces Irish whiskey, to taste
4 ounces fresh-brewed coffee
1/2 to 1 ounce simple syrup
Heavy cream
Directions
1. Whip the cream until thick, but not stiff. In a pre-warmed toddy mug, Irish coffee glass or sturdy wine glass, combine the whiskey, simple syrup and coffee (for more richness of flavor without added sweetness, try making the simple syrup using brown sugar or demerara sugar). Stir to combine, and gently spoon between 1/2-inch and an inch of cream atop the coffee mixture, to taste.
